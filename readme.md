## Notes on this project

This is a pre-project made in JS for a React project I want to create later.

I will make a game where a user is presented with two images from the NASA API and they pick the correct one matching the name they see.

I will make a game where a description of the object is given and the image of some items and the user has to match the image and description.

Another idea: a game where four objects are given, and they are two matching sets. The user has to match the items with each other.

The challenge here is going to be position randomization.
